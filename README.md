# Machine-learning-project
Project Proposal:
Dataset
For this project, we have chosen the CIFAR-100 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 RGB images and features 100 classes.
Out of the 60,000 images, the dataset is divided into 50,000 training and 10,000 testing samples.
For our project, we will omit 10% of the classes and use them as an Out-of-Distribution dataset that won't be learned by our models.
Research Questions & Project Goals:
 Compare classical machine learning models to each other as well as to a deep learning classifier.
 Explore why some models are better suited for image classification than others
 Implement some technique for detecting Out-of-Distribution samples on suitable models and compare their relative performance.
Techniques & Algorithms:

 Decision Trees

 Deep Learning

 Multi-layered Perceptron

 SVM

 KMeans

 AdaBoost
